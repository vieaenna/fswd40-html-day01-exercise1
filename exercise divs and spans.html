			Once upon a time you dressed so fine<br>
			Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?<br>
People call say 'beware doll, you're bound to fall'<br>
You thought they were all kidding you<br>
You used to laugh about<br>
Everybody that was hanging out<br>
Now you don't talk so loud<br>
Now you don't seem so proud<br>
About having to be scrounging your next meal

	<b>How does it feel, how does it feel?<br>
To be without a home<br>

Ahh you've gone to the finest schools, alright Miss Lonely <br>
But you know you only used to get juiced in it<br>
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street<br>
And now you're gonna have to get used to it<br>
You say you never compromise<br>
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize<br>
He's not selling any alibis<br>
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes<br>
And say do you want to make a deal?<br>

Ah you never turned around to see the frowns<br>
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you<br>
You never understood that it ain't no good<br>
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you<br>
You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat<br>
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat<br>
Ain't it hard when you discovered that<br>
He really wasn't where it's at<br>
After he took from you everything he could steal<br>

Ahh princess on a steeple and all the pretty people<br>
They're all drinking, thinking that they've got it made<br>
Exchanging all precious gifts<br>
But you better take your diamond ring, you better pawn it babe<br>
You used to be so amused<br>
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used<br>
Go to him he calls you, you can't refuse<br>
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose<br>
You're invisible now, you've got no secrets to conceal<br>
